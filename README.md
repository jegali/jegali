## Latest Project
At the moment, I am setting up a hackable webshop for penetration testing trainings. It will be deployed as a docker image - and I will report how I built it.

## Other Projects
[Project: Cloudberry Cluster](https://github.com/jegali/Cloudberry-Cluster) <br/>
In this repository, I show how I built my Raspberry Kubernetes cluster - including a small hardware project that deals with creating a front panel with LED and on/off switches so that the cluster can be conveniently started and shut down. <br/><br/>
[Project: Dockerized Webshop Environment](https://github.com/jegali/docker-nginx-mysql-php-phpmyadmin)
I tried to build my own docker image for my hackable webshop. This is the first try where I build a multiple container environment using docker-compose to set up a workspace with NGinx as a web server, mariaDB as database System, PHP as programming language and an phpMyAdmin administration interface.

## Latest Project
At the moment, I am setting up a hackable webshop for penetration testing trainings. It will be deployed as a docker image - and I will report how I built it.

## Other Projects
[Project: Cloudberry Cluster](https://github.com/jegali/Cloudberry-Cluster) <br/>
In this repository, I show how I built my Raspberry Kubernetes cluster - including a small hardware project that deals with creating a front panel with LED and on/off switches so that the cluster can be conveniently started and shut down. <br/><br/>

[Project: HealthPi](https://github.com/jegali/HealthPi) <br/>
To monitor the health status of my Raspberry Pi and later, my Raspberry Pi cluster, I decided to write a centralized monitoring solution for CPU utilization, Temperature, Memory ussage and hard disk usage. A client on the Raspberry collects the data and log it to my Ubuntu Server for evaluation and reporting. Using Dash and Python, the data is visualized and served via a Flask application. <br/><br/>

[Project: Dockerized Webshop Environment](https://github.com/jegali/docker-nginx-mysql-php-phpmyadmin) <br/>
I tried to build my own docker image for my hackable webshop. This is the first try where I build a multiple container environment using docker-compose to set up a workspace with NGinx as a web server, mariaDB as database System, PHP as programming language and an phpMyAdmin administration interface. The webshop source code is not part of this repository.<br/><br/>

[Project: mandelPi](https://github.com/jegali/MandelPi) <br/>
Being an addict to the Mandelbrot set since my early age, I decided to do a rewrite in Python using techniques of parallel computing to utilize more threads and cores.<br/><br/>

[Project: Networks](https://github.com/jegali/networks) <br/>
During the Udacity scholarship "Cloud native architecture and development" I was asked to give a talk on networks, protocols and infrastructure. These are the slides I used to entertain people from three different time zones (US, Europe and India) for four hours. Cheers!<br/><br/>
